# Eirini Demo


This repo consists of a [backend COBOL app](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/eirini-demo/tree/master/demo-backend) and a [frontend Node App](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/eirini-demo/tree/master/demo-frontend). The focus here is to understand how these two apps can be deployed and managed with one Cloud Foundry Enterprise Environment instance.

A frontend Node.js shopping cart app is talking to the backend Cobol app to fetch the shopping cart products.

Steps involved:

1. Deploy the [backend COBOL app](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/eirini-demo/tree/master/demo-backend).
1. Deploy the [frontend Node.js app](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/eirini-demo/tree/master/demo-frontend).
